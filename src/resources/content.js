        <p>
          ðŸ‘‹ Hiya! I'm Nick, a passionate Web Developer. ðŸ’»
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I have a knack for bridging the gap between non-technical needs and technical solutions, turning "wish lists"
          into functional web solutions.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Whether it's creating new web pages, integrating features, or fine-tuning what's already there, I make it my
          mission to understanding the needs of non-technical stakeholders and bring their ideas to life through code
          refinement and innovative problem-solving.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I thrive on continuous learning and enjoy revisiting projects with new skills to find fresh solutions. With
          expertise in HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and more, I'm equipped to contribute creatively and technically to
          any project.
